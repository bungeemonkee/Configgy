## Pipeline - Coerce

The fifth and final pipeline step is coercion. This is the step where a raw, transformed, validated value is converted to a usable object.

The interface for all coercers is `Configgy.Coercion.IValueCoercer`.

The default coercer is `Configgy.Coercion.AggregateCoerver`. This coercer uses three coercers by default:

1. One can create instances of [`System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.regularexpressions.regex(v=vs.110).aspx) (by parsing the string using the regular Regex constructor)
2. One can create instances of [`System.Type`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.type(v=vs.110).aspx) (by looking up a type using a raw string value representing the type name)
3. The other can parse all primitive types and nearly every other type built into .NET by using the [`TypeConverter`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.typeconverter%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) instances provided by [`TypeDescriptor.GetConverter()`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w202c8fy%28v=vs.110%29.aspx). In order to allow this coercer to successfully parse any custom types you can [implement a custom `TypeDescriptor`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171819.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396) for that type.

### CSV Properties

For properties that are simple arrays of objects there is a coercer that can parse these lists: `Configgy.Coercion.CsvCoercerAttribute`. This coercer returns an array of the parsed objects of the given type. Simply apply the attribute to the array property. The property could also be of type `IEnumerable`, `IEnumerable<T>`, `IList`, or `IList<T>` as arrays can be cast to all these types.

### Json/Xml Properties

For properties that are complex objects Configgy provides coercers that can take raw values in either json or xml and deserialize complex objects from them. __Json is highly recommended over xml__ due to the facts that json is simpler and more compact, and the [`System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.serialization.datacontractserializer(v=vs.110).aspx) class which is used internally has many (often undocumented) idiosyncrasies.

### Custom Coercers

Any custom coercer simply need be a property attribute that implements [`IValueCoercer`](../Configgy/Coercion/IValueCoercer.cs) respectively. It is recommended that you inherit from [`ValueCoercerAttributeBase`](../Configgy/Coercion/ValueCoercerAttributeBase.cs) respectively. Then just apply your custom coercer attribute to the property.
